  ## Description 
  Using command line prompts, the user can create a nice display of an engineering team including important information about each team member.  This starts with the team manager that includes name, ID number, email as well as the manager's office number.  Then the user can input engineers and interns, both with their names, ID numbers and emails.  The user also inputs the engineer's gitHub username as well as what school the intern attended.
